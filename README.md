# Scoundrel (Godot Pixel-Art Edition)

A pixel-art recreation of the card-based dungeon crawler Scoundrel, built in Godot as a hobby project to learn pixel art and game development.

## About

Scoundrel is a minimalist dungeon crawler where the entire dungeon is represented by a deck of 52 cards. Each card you flip reveals either a monster, a weapon, or a heart. Your choices determine your survival.

## Gameplay

- **Explore the deck**: Draw cards one by one to reveal what lies ahead
- **Make strategic decisions**: Fight monsters, heal yourself, escape danger, or upgrade your weapon
- **Survive to win**: Reach the end of the 52-card deck with health remaining

## Inspiration

Based on the original Scoundrel card game, reimagined with pixel art aesthetics.

## License

**Code**: Free to use for learning and personal projects.

**Art Assets**: All pixel art and visual assets are created by us and require proper credit if used. Please credit both creators if you use any art from this project.

# Scoundrel (Godot Pixel-Art Edition)

A pixel-art recreation of the card-based dungeon crawler Scoundrel, built in Godot as a hobby project to learn pixel art and game development.

## About

Scoundrel is a minimalist dungeon crawler where the entire dungeon is represented by a deck of 52 cards. Each card you flip reveals either a monster, a weapon, or a heart. Your choices determine your survival.

## Gameplay

- **Explore the deck**: Draw cards one by one to reveal what lies ahead
- **Make strategic decisions**: Fight monsters, heal yourself, escape danger, or upgrade your weapon
- **Survive to win**: Reach the end of the 52-card deck with health remaining

## Inspiration

Based on the original Scoundrel card game, reimagined with pixel art aesthetics.

## License

This is a personal hobby project. Feel free to use it for learning purposes.
